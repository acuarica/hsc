# Notes

- performance testing random haskell
- invertible functions? generate instance. random generator.
- cost function, which one to use? estimate. quickcheck to estimate cost.
- optimizations in the fix point rewrite rule.
  Use dynamic programming to implement it.
why map f.g xs is better than map f map g xs?
  map f xs ++ map f ys bettter/worst than map f (xs++ys)
- bake all optimizations into the rules?
