	that includes both partial evaluation and
	deforestation. Although known in the West since
	1979, the essence of its techniques, its more
	precise relations to other transformers, and the
	properties of the programs that it produces are only
	now becomming apparent in the Western functional
	programming community.  This thesis gives a new
	formulation of the supercompiler in familiar terms;
	we study the essence of it, how it achieves its
	effects, and its relations to related transformers;
	and we develop results dealing with the problems of
	preserving semantics, assessing the efficiency of
	transformed programs, and ensuring termination.}}
