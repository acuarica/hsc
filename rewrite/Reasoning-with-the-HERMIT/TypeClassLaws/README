Note: this case study requires GHC 7.8 to run.

First install HERMIT version 1.0.0.0, which can be done via Cabal:

> cabal update
> cabal install hermit-1.0.0.0

To run the entire case study, invoke HERMIT in this directory as follows:

> hermit Laws.hs All.hec

If it runs successfully, you can use the HERMIT command "show-lemmas" to display all the lemmas (which should be noted as proved).

hermit> show-lemmas

To run the proofs for an individual type, run one of the following:

> hermit Laws.hs +Laws Start.hec Maybe.hec
> hermit Laws.hs +Laws Start.hec List.hec

If you wish to stop a proof midway, find the appropriate proof in one of the script files and insert a 'stop-script' command where desired.

To run the proofs for the Map type in the containers package, do the following:

> cd containers
> hermit laws/Laws.hs +Main laws/Functor.hec laws/Monoid.hec

Or, to run them as part of cabal's build:

> cd containers
> cabal configure --enable-tests
> cabal build
